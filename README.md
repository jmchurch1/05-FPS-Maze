# Project 05-FPS-Maze
Project 5 for MSCH-C220

This project includes a procedurally generated maze as well as some fps mechanics

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.3

- simple character from Kenney.nl Blocky Character pack
- "Chase At Rush Hour" by Patrick De Arteaga
- Zombie 7 by Joseph Sardin (BigSoundBank.com)
- Paralines by Lewis Lantham (https://www.behance.net/gallery/28060847/Paralines-Free-Font)

## References
- I watched quite a few tutorials other than your videos for this project to try and get a better understanding of working in 3D, it was mostly for raycasting stuff.

## Future Development
- I will probably add a gun shooting sound effect and a particle effect like jelly exploding when the bullets hit something
